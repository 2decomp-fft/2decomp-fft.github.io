Fast Fourier Transforms
=========================

The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) plays an important role in many scientific and technical applications, including time-series and waveform analysis, solutions to linear partial
differential equations, convolution, digital signal processing, and image filtering. Many algorithms have been proposed to compute DFTs with a good efficiency and the most famous clas of efficient algorithms is generally referred to as fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms.


The 2Decomp&FFT is providing an API to perform FFTs at scale using a 2D Domain Decomposition on CPUs and on GPUs. There are hundreds of FFT software packages available but only few of them suitable for multi-GPUs.
